urgent assistant Dear Sir/Madam I know this letter will come as a surprise to you, but i would like you to give it a top consideration so as to help me and my family from our present predicament. I am Michael James, the first son of Mr Leonard James, a British Farmer based in Zimbabwe. My father is now dead as a result of his incarceration by the Zimbabwean Government under President Robert Mugabe who ordered the white farmers in Zimbabwe to vacate their Farm Land and go back to their country. But my father, due to his large investment in the Farm Land refused to quit Zimbabwe for his country. Based on this reason he was arrested and imprisoned and as a result of his protracted sickness [Diabetics] he died in Manfe prison on 19 sept 2002. May his gentle soul rest in perfect peace. After his death, all efforts by my mother who is a Zimbabwean to secure most of my father's investment was frustrated by the President Mugabes Government. Towards this end my mother discovered an original certificate of deposit for a trunk box containing the sum of USD9,000,000.00 ( Nine million U.S.Dollars) deposited by my late father in custody of a security trust company in Dubai, UAE. The money belonged to the White Farmers Association [W. F. A] which my late father was the Founder/President with the help of my maternal uncle who was a Comissioner in Zimbabwe. We are able to trace the security trust company to Dubai [U.A.E] where the box containing the money is presently deposited, declared as Family Jewellries and Antiquities as to avoid raising any eye brow from the authority here. All documented proofs in respect of this deposited consignment are in my pocession. As it is, I am looking for a reliable partner who can help me safe-guide and invest this money very prudently in his company as advised by my mother. 20% of this money will be given to you while 5% will be set aside for miscellanous expenses that we may incure during the process. Also note that this transaction is 100% risk free, you may also be required to come to Dubai if need be on indication of your interest. Please confirm your interest on this transaction and contact me on my email address; michaeljames@Z6.com I am presently in Dubai [U A E]. Hoping to hear from you soonest. Thanks and Remain blessed Michael James
